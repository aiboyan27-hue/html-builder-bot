              The Prime Cleaner began as a simple idea — to bring a more personal, trustworthy touch to cleaning. What started with just the two of them, cleaning homes with care and consistency, quickly grew through word of mouth and repeat bookings. People loved not just the results, but the care and reliability behind each visit.

              While we've grown since those early days, our mission remains the same: to bring you peace of mind in a neat & clean space. We're building a team that shares those values — friendly faces who treat every home like their own. No matter how big we get, that "family-run" feeling stays at the heart of everything we do.
